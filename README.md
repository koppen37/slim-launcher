> [!NOTE]
> This is a fork of the original [slim launcher](https://github.com/sduduzog/slim-launcher) for my personal use.
> It contains the following changes:
> - Updated dependencies/gradle
> - Added search functionality to launch apps
> - Show/hide quick shortcuts (camera/telephone)
> - Toggle on/off clock/calendar as shortcuts to corresponding apps
